## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ansible
- Wireshark
- Volatility
- tcpdump

### Setup Instructions

1. **Capture Network Traffic:**
   Execute the following command to capture network traffic:
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 1000 -w pcap/capture_all.pcap
   
2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
Open the capture_all.pcap file in Wireshark.
Apply filters to focus on HTTP and HTTPS traffic

3. **Run Python Analysis Scripts:**
Execute the following command to analyze traffic data:
python3 scripts/analyze_traffic.py

4. **Conduct Memory Analysis:**
Use Volatility to analyze memory images:
volatility -f mem_dump.raw --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist

5. **Enforce Security Policies with Ansible:**
Run the following command to enforce security policies:
ansible-playbook ansible/security_policies.yml


## Results
- Packet Analysis: Successfully captured and analyzed network traffic, identifying suspicious connections for further investigation.
- Digital Forensic Analysis: Conducted thorough memory and log analysis to uncover potential security incidents.
- Security Policies: Developed compliance verification scripts and implemented network-wide policies using Ansible.


## Conclusion
This project showcases a holistic approach to cybersecurity, demonstrating expertise in network monitoring, forensic analysis, and security policy implementation. It serves as a valuable asset for any cybersecurity professional's portfolio.
